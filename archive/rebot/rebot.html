                        <p>REbot was create as a school project for Digital Media Studio 5: Recreating from others' creation. The main purpose of the project was take inspiration from existed works of other artist(s) and twisting those works to create your own.</p>

                        <p>I really enjoy comic superheroes and mech fight at the same time so I decided to take that inspiration and blend them together to create REbot - a project featuring fighting superheroes-look-a-like robots in the scene of old arcade fighting games.</p>

                                        <p>During the dark days of the early 1940's, a covert US military experiment turned Steve Rogers into America's first Super-Soldier, Captain America. Throughout the war, Cap and his partner Bucky Barnes fought alongside infantry and with a group of heroes known as the Invaders. In the closing months of World War II, Captain America and Bucky were both presumed dead in an explosion. Few decades later, Captain America was found trapped in ice and revived in the modern world.</p>

                                        <p>The reluctant leader of the X-Men who shoots concussive blasts from his eyes, Scott Summers has been fighting for the peaceful coexistence of mutants and humans most of his life. Cyclops has been deputy leader of the X-Men since his teen years and has seen the team go through a myriad of changes.</p>

                                        <p>The day I try to figure it out who to draw next, Thor 3 trailer came out, so I decided to draw Thor.</p>
                                        <p>Thor is the blood-son of Odin, All-Father of the Asgardians, and Jord, who was also known as Gaea, the goddess who was one of the Elder Gods. Odin sought to father a son whose power would derive from both Asgard and Midgard (as the Earth realm is called by Asgardians), and hence he sought to mate with Jord. Odin created a cave in Norway where Jord gave birth to Thor. Months after the infant Thor was weaned, Odin brought him to Asgard to be raised. Odin's wife, the goddess Frigga, acted as Thor's mother from that time onward. Not until many decades later did Thor learn that Jord was his birth mother.</p>

He was the first human ever inducted into the Green Lantern Corps, and has been heralded as possibly the greatest Green Lantern of all time. Hal is also a founding member of the Justice League of America.</p>

                                        <p>Barry Allen is the fastest man alive and the second speedster known as The Flash. In his secret identity he is a police officer working in Central City as a forensics specialist. His legacy is the Flash Family, he was inspired by Jay Garrick of the Justice Society and has been succeeded by Kid Flash (Wally West) and Impulse (Bart Allen). Barry's running generates the Speed Force, an enigmatic source of energy that all other speedsters tap into throughout time.</p>

                                        <p>Superman is the most powerful being on planet Earth, an alien immigrant named Kal-El from the planet Krypton who was raised in Smallville, Kansas, to become an American superhero. Raised with high moral ideals, he uses his incredible strength, speed, flight and various other superpowers to fight evil and protect the innocent. In his civilian identity he is Clark Kent, a mild-mannered reporter working for the Daily Planet in Metropolis.<p>
                                        <p>Batman is the super-hero protector of Gotham City, a man dressed like a bat who fights against evil and strikes terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere. In his secret identity, he assumes the alias of Bruce Wayne, billionaire industrialist and notorious playboy; though "Bruce Wayne" is technically his real name, this Bruce Wayne is a disguise--that of the man he would have been had his parents not been murdered before his eyes when he was no more than a mere boy.</p>
                                        <p>These looks fine, I dig the style. Let's see how it goes with this.</p>

                                    <p>After a while, I reallize I don't really like this style very much. I looked at one of my drawing years ago and I noticed that the style of that old painting and the hulk one that I made the other day was the exact same thing, and no one like your new works look identical to one that you made years ago when you was just a noviced.</p>

                                    <p>I'm not anywhere near a decent illustrator but I'm also far from what I was back then, and as more as I look at it, I hate the style of the Hulk-bot, it was too simple, too sloppy, too cramped and too flat. No way in the world I can keep on drawing this without stuck myself up and block my own way of drawing in the rest of this project so I decided that I would have to scrap it and go for a new style.</p>
                                    <p>I will start sketching somes, more on this on the next post.</p>

                                    <p>Well, this is my first finished one. I decided to draw The Hulk because he is closedly resemble to a human being with some easy traits to exaggerate. The Hulk is a very gigantic figure and also a very clumsy one so I tried to draw him with a very bulky body.</p>
                                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7Wd8SA6.jpg" class="post-img">
                                    <p>You can see that I give the Hulk-bot fists of two heavy metal balls without any fingers for a clumsy look. The short leg also give a feeling that it's not a very fast robot. I use a very cartoonish look to keep the drawing fresh and light, not being too heavy.</p>

                                    <p>At the very beginning, I was very confused with what was tasked for, I usually have a specific brief of what to do for every assignment but for this one, the task was to figuring out somethings your own, which kinda confusing for me.</p>
                                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xhdul2N.jpg" class="post-img">
                                    <p>My first idea to “recreating others’ creation” is to mixing characters of an actor across movie. For example, taking Deadpool and Green Lantern, both played by Ryan Reynold and swap them with each other, bringing Deadpool to the Green Lanterns’ universe and also the other way. But later I scrapped the idea and turn it into a different one.</p>
                                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SfPN1LG.jpg" class="post-img">
                                    <p>Since I was small, I was really enjoyed arcade platformer fighting games like Street Fighter, Bloody Roar and more recently, Super Smash Bros. I also loves superheroes and robot, so I figure I’m gonna merge theme all together. That was how I came up with the idea to turn supeheroes into robot and put them into to fighting stages just like those 80s’ arcade fighting games.</p>
                                    <p>What’s next was the hard part, give it a name.</p>
